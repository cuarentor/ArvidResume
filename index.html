          <h2>Summary</h2>
           <p>Passionate gamer with over 37 years of continuous experience (since the Atari 2600 era in 1987), combined with practical expertise in alpha testing for MMORPGs (under NDA) and strong skills in web design and development. My proficiency in HTML, CSS, and web technologies, paired with meticulous attention to detail, enables me to identify bugs and enhance player experiences in HTML5 games. As a dedicated technology enthusiast, I stay updated, thrive on solving technical challenges, and find great satisfaction in detecting and resolving issues. My enthusiasm drives my ability to adapt quickly, collaborate effectively in teams, and contribute to shared goals. I am excited to bring my problem-solving mindset, testing expertise, and deep gaming knowledge to the Games Tester role at Playstack OÜ, helping to deliver exceptional gaming experiences..</p>

          <h2>Technical Showcase: Building This Page</h2>
          <p>This CV webpage itself was built as a practical exercise, demonstrating familiarity with a modern front-end development workflow. The process involved leveraging the **Node.js** ecosystem:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>**Initialization & Setup:** The project was scaffolded using **Vite**, a fast build tool chosen for its efficient development server with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).</li>
             <li>**Dependency Management:** Project dependencies, including the **Sass** preprocessor, were managed using **npm** (Node Package Manager).</li>
             <li>**Structure:** Content was structured using semantic **HTML5** tags for clarity and accessibility.</li>
             <li>**Styling:** Visual presentation was handled with **SCSS**, taking advantage of variables, nesting, and functions. Layouts were implemented using **Flexbox** for responsive design.</li>
             <li>**Enhancements:** **Custom Fonts** (Google Fonts) were integrated, and subtle interactivity was added via **CSS Animations** and Transitions.</li>
              <li>**Build & Deployment:** The final assets were bundled for production using Vite's build process and deployed to **[Your Hosting Platform]**.</li>
         </ul>
          <p>This approach demonstrates an understanding of the toolchain commonly used in modern web projects. The complete source code is available on GitHub <a href="[Link to your CV's GitHub Repo]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
